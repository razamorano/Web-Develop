Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class: part that you can apply to just one line
#id: specify a children of the class
* : apply to all elements, needs to be place at the top
element : it just apply to the element mentioned
element, element : apply to both elements
element1 element2 : applies to the elements2 contained on element1 only
element1 > element1: apply to element2 as long as the element is a children of element1
element1 + element2: it apply to any element2 which is inside to the element1

All this properties needs to be used at the end of the elements ie. h2: hover
:hover (flotar) : ideally for button, it change the style when you put the cursor onto
:last-child : it makes reference to the style to just the last child
:first-child : it makes reference to just the first child
!important (not recommended) : is using after the style and apply even if after you create a new style on the cascade ie p{ color: pink !importante; }


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity // speciality.keegan.st (speciality calculator
-Importance // referees on !important
-Source Order // the source order also affect on the html reference
